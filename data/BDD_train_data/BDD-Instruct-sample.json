      "q": "Offer an explanation of the driving scene presented.",
      "a": "The driving scene begins with the ego-car moving forward straight down the road due to green traffic lights, meaning the road ahead is clear to proceed. Next, the car gently drifts into the left lane as the traffic continues to move ahead, indicating that the driver intends to follow the flow of the traffic. Shortly, the driver decides to shift back to the right lane, possibly because the other cars in the left lane are starting to queue up in order to make a turn. This could mean that the driver wants to avoid potential delays and keep going at a steady pace. Finally, the car continues to drive forward in the right lane, as it is clear with no obstructions or interruptions. This likely indicates that the driver is aware of the road conditions and positions of other vehicles on the road, prioritizing safety and smooth flow."

      "q": "Present a compact description of the driver's actions and cause to explain these actions.",
      "a": "Initially, the driver moves straight, following the direction of the traffic as the traffic light is green. Next, the driver changes lanes, drifting into the left lane, keeping up with the flowing traffic. Then, to avoid the congestion caused by the cars waiting to turn in the left lane, the driver efficiently shifts to the right lane. Finally, seeing that the lane is clear with no obstructions, the driver continues to drive forward, maintaining the safe and steady flow of the journey. Throughout the whole situation, the driver's actions seem to be dictated by the traffic conditions, traffic signals, and road circumstances, indicating a mindful and adaptable approach to driving."

      "q": "Explain the driver's behavior in the scene, including the road objects and the traffic.",
      "a": "First, the scene begins with the ego-car stationary at a standstill. The path in front of the ego-car is blocked due to traffic, which is also at a halt. In this phase, there are a handful of other vehicles around; a couple of cars right ahead, one of them being extremely close and another at some distance on the far right. There's also an additional car on the right side of our ego-car, albeit somewhat off to the side. \n\nNext, the traffic begins to gradually clear up, and the car\u2019s activity reflects that; the ego-car starts to inch slowly forward and veers slightly left. The vehicles ahead are moving forward at a sluggish pace which allows the ego-car to also proceed ahead. The car right in front of the ego-car doesn't seem to have moved much, but the car on the right which was at some distance, appears marginally closer on the horizontal axis. Meanwhile, the car on the ego-car\u2019s right disregards the rest and maintains its position. \n\nIn conclusion, the overall driver's behavior suggests their strict adherence to traffic rules and careful driving, manoeuvering slowly in response to the traffic movement and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles."

    "QA": {
      "q": "Present a compact description of the driver's actions and cause to explain these actions.",
      "a": "Firstly, the ego-car comes to a halt since there is a line of stationary traffic ahead. Several vehicles are present ahead of the car as well as one in the right lane. The relative positioning of these vehicles doesn't seem to change after a while, suggesting that traffic is indeed not moving. \n\nNext, as the traffic begins to shift over to the center lane, the ego-car slowly moves from the right lane to the center lane, tailing the same cars that were initially ahead. All the vehicles in front appear to maintain their positions with minor positional adjustments, signifying that the traffic merge is happening gradually. Therefore, the ego-car's maneuver to the center lane is attributed to the change in the flow of traffic. The driver is taking precautions and following the new traffic direction to keep the flow steady."
